# Git vs GitHub, Remote Repositories, and Learning Goals

---

## Notes on Git vs GitHub
- Common misconception: **Git ≠ GitHub**
- **Git**: distributed version control system  
  - Installed locally on a machine  
  - Manages source code  
  - Tracks history of modifications  
- **GitHub**: cloud-based platform built around Git  
  - Provides collaboration environment  
  - Hosts repositories online  
  - Lets developers connect, upload, and download resources  
- Key takeaway:  
  - Git = the tool  
  - GitHub = the hosting service for Git repositories  

---

## Transition to Remote Repositories
- Moving beyond **local repositories** → introducing **remote repositories**  
- Importance: enables **team collaboration** across different machines  
- Focus areas in this module:  
  - Remote collaboration mechanics  
  - Standard team workflows  
  - Best practices for using remotes  
- Remote Git can be complex → tools and resources provided to build confidence

## GitHub as a Collaborative Platform
- GitHub is central to this module’s curriculum  
- Platform highlights:  
  - Host and review code  
  - Manage projects and workflows  
  - Work with a huge developer community (~36 million developers)  
  - Supports both open-source and commercial projects

- 4.2: Show your repository's releases and tags  

### Course Learning Objective 7  
**Create organized and visually appealing project documentation**  
- Use tools like READMEs, markdown, and wikis  

**Supporting Learning Goals**
